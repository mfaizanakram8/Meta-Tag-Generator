(9, 'Online safety and best practices', 'online-safety-and-best-practices', '<p><strong>By engaging </strong>in an online community, like codehap, you are potentially exposing yourself to safety risks. Here are some basic tips that we recommend you practice while interacting with people on codehap.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; margin-left:2em\">\r\n	<li>Don&#39;t share personal information with people you meet on codehap. Personal information means &quot;information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single person or can be used with other sources to uniquely identify a single individual&quot;. Here are some examples of personal information:</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Full name</li>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Phone number</li>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Bank details</li>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Home address</li>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Facebook ID or other similar IDs</li>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Websites containing information described above or information about your relatives, friends etc.</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; margin-left:2em\">\r\n	<li>Think twice before you share your email or instant messaging address with people on codehap. The person you shared it with may not be the one he/she claimed to be and his/her intentions may not be fully disclosed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; margin-left:2em\">\r\n	<li>Don&#39;t send personal pictures to people you meet on codehap.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; margin-left:2em\">\r\n	<li>Be careful when opening files sent from people on codehap. They can be harmful to your computer or it may not be the content that you think it is.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; margin-left:2em\">\r\n	<li>We discourage having real-life meetings with people you met on codehap. If you feel safe and still want to do it, you should follow these guidelines:</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Always consult your parents or a trusted adult before you decide to meet someone. If possible, bring an adult to the encounter.</li>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Let people know where you&#39;re going and when you&#39;ll be back from the encounter.</li>\r\n		<li style=\"list-style-type:square\">Always arrange the meeting in a very public place like a popular coffee shop, a busy shopping mall, or similar place.</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; margin-left:2em\">\r\n	<li>If you decide to tell someone your age and/or gender, be honest about it. Being dishonest about your age/gender can lead to awkward, and potentially dangerous situations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc; margin-left:2em\">\r\n	<li>Take threats, cyberbullying and other illegal activity seriously! If you feel that someone is threatening, bullying or performing other illegal activities to you, or someone else on codehap - be quick to report this behavior to codehap. If you know or suspect that a criminal act has taken place or may happen, report the case to your local police.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend that you take a look at these resources for more information:<br />\r\n<a class=\"ul\" href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/internet-safety.html\" target=\"_blank\">kidshealth.org/en/teens/internet-safety.html</a><br />\r\n<a class=\"ul\" href=\"http://www.wiredsafety.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.wiredsafety.com/</a></p>\r\n', '2022-06-25 10:20:29', NULL);
